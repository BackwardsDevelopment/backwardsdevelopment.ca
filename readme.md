# BackwardsDevelopment.ca
[BackwardsDevelopment.ca](https://www.backwardsdevelopment.ca) is my Official website.  
This website is used to showcase, and sell my work. This is the source code for the page as I believe that most things should be open sourced, as the best way to improve your work is by giving the public the opportunity to look over your work, searching for errors, or something they think could be done slightly better.

## Usage
Feel free to use this work, reminder it is under the [MIT license](https://www.tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license). So make sure to give that a read before using, also while it's not required, I would appreciate if you'd change the titles, etc.

## Contributions
I'm not really looking for contributions to this page.
Anything within the main branch of this repository will likely find its way onto my server.
However don't be afraid to open a pull request. I will still look over pull requests, I'm just going to be a little more strict with what I allow.

**TL;DR**: Feel free to open a pull request or issue. Although It will be more strict than my other repos.
