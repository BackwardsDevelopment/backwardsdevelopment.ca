                <h2>Alexander</h2>
                <h3>Who I am</h3>
                <p>My name is Alexander Harding, I am a 19 year old College Student Studding Software Development at
                    Mohawk
                    College.</p>
                <p>I love coding, My favourite thing to code are Discord Bots, they're super simple to get running and
                    it's
                    super cool to visually see the bot coming online.</p>
                <p>My favourite project I am working on is my Chat Room, Its been a great learning experience,
                    understanding
                    the way the client works with a database via a server and understanding basic concepts of
                    encryption.
                </p>
                <h3>What I do</h3>
                <p>I am a developer who dabbles in most areas of Software, and Computers in general.</p>
                <p>I began developing Discord Bots. I have developed multiple Discord bots from moderation bots to
                    simple
                    music bots.</p>
                <p>With the development of Discord bots I realized that they were difficult to put together so I began
                    developing an application that could be used to create, manage and run your own Discord bot, however
                    this project has since been archived.
                </p>
                <p>From here I started making simple websites, websites for close friends and family. That I hosted on a
                    local server.</p>
                <p>My most recent and biggest project thus far has been my chat application, I started working on this
                    chat
                    application because I was curious on how such an application would work. Thus far it has been a very
                    educational experience learning the basics of encryption and how to transfer messages.</p>
                <h3>My Future Plans</h3>
                <p>My true goal is to have a happy life. I like to try things, if a new opportunity presents itself to
                    me I
                    am likely to give it a try. My intention is to get a job with a company like Discord.</p>
                <p>I strive to do better, any app, tool or assignment I complete I want to improve, I want to make
                    something
                    better. I have a need to improve everything I work on.</p>
                <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
                <p>I love everything. You name it I've likely tried it. I've used Blender, I like using Blender, but the
                    time consumption of it kind of turns me away, however if I sat down for a couple hours I could
                    likely
                    get something that looks good. I've tried the Unity engine, however its been some time and I'd need
                    to
                    learn it again. I've tried the Unreal engine, however I didn't put much time into it as by the time
                    installation was complete I had lost interest in making any game, although the engine does look
                    enticing.</p>
